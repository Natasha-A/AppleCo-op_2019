/*:
 ## Exercise - Constants
 
 Declare a constant called `friends` to represent the number of friends you have on social media. Give it a value between 50 and 1000. Print out the value by referencing your constant.
 */
var friend = 60

// print("I have \(friend) friends")

/*:
 Now assume you go through and remove friends that aren't active on social media. Update your `friends` constant to a lower number than it currently is.
 */
friend = 40
print("I have \(friend) friends")

print("this occurs since the code is gone through from top to bottom, so it needs the print function to be given again")
/*:
 Does the above code compile? Why not? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function. Go back and delete your line of code that updates the `friend` constant to a lower number so that the playground will compile properly.
