 ## App Exercise - Workout or Nil
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 Have you ever accidentally tapped a button in an app? It's fairly common. In your fitness tracking app, you decide that if a user accidentally taps a button to start a workout and then ends the workout within 10 seconds, you simply don't want to create and log the workout. Otherwise the user would have to go delete the workout from the log.
 
 Create a `Workout` struct that has properties `startTime` and `endTime` of type `Double`. Dates are difficult to work with, so you'll be using doubles to represent the number of seconds since midnight, i.e. 28800 would represent 28,800 seconds, which is exactly 8 hours, so the start time is 8am.
 
 Write a failable initializer that takes parameters for your start and end times, and then checks to see if they are fewer than 10 seconds apart. If they are, your initializer should fail. Otherwise, they should set the properties accordingly.
 */
struct Workout {
    var startTime: Double //workout time properties
    var endTime: Double

    init?(startTime: Double, endTime: Double) { //failable initalizer using properties
        if startTime > 0 && endTime < 10 { // if the time duration is under 10 seconds, the workout log is deleted (no value)
            return nil
        } else {
            self.startTime = startTime //self stores names in order to be used in instances
            self.endTime = endTime
        }
    }
}
//instance 1
var deleteLog = Workout(startTime: 2, endTime: 9)
print(deleteLog) // prints: nil (values between less than 10 seconds, if condition true

//instance 2
var keepLog = Workout(startTime: 1, endTime: 100)
//use optional binding to make non-nil keepLog(not in 10 sec range) value remove optional from instanblce by setting to new variable as logToKeep
if let logToKeep = keepLog {
    print("New log: \(logToKeep.startTime) sec to \(logToKeep.endTime) sec")

}
/*:
 Try to initialize two instances of a `Workout` object and print each of them. One of them should not be initialized because the start and end times are too close together. The other should successfully initialize a `Workout` object.
